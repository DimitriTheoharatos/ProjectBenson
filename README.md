## EDA of MTA Subway Data
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY- a fictitious organization) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As they are new and inclusive organization, they try to do double duty with the gala both to fill their event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.

This project aims to analyze turnstile data coupled with demographic data to determine the optimal locations to accumulate several gala attendees as well as target specific people we believe are likely to donate to the WTWY cause.
